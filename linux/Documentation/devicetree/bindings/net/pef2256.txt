* Wan on Infineon pef2256 E1 controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "infineon,pef2256"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain interrupts

Optional properties:
- data-rate: Data rate on the system highway.
  Supported values are: 2, 4, 8, 16.
  8 if not defined.
- channel-phase: First time slot transmission channel phase.
  Supported values are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
  0 if not defined.
- rising-edge-sync-pulse: rising edge synchronous pulse.
  Supported values are: "receive", "transmit".
  "transmit" if not defined.

Examples:

	e1-wan@4,2000000 {
		compatible = "infineon,pef2256";
		reg = <4 0x2000000 0xFF>;
		interrupts = <8 1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&PIC>;
		data-rate = <4>;
		channel-phase = <1>;
		rising-edge-sync-pulse = "transmit";
	};
