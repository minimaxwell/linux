* Wan on Infineon pef2256 E1 controller

The pef2256 is a E1/T1/J1 Framer and Line Interface Component for Long- and
Short-Haul Applications.
Its datashhet can be downloaded at
http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheets_pdf/P/E/F/2/PEF2256E.shtml

The FALC®56 framer and line interface component is designed to fulfill all required
interfacing between analog E1 lines and the digital PCM system highway, H.100/H.110
or H-MVIP bus.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "infineon,pef2256"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
  There should be a single continuous bank.
- interrupts: Should contain the single interrupt used by the component to notify
  special events (error, data received, data transmitted, ...).

Optional properties:

These properties can be defined to adjust the system interface in E1 mode.

The FALC®56 offers a flexible feature for system designers where for transmit and
receive direction different system clocks and system pulses are necessary. The interface
to the receive system highway is realized by two data buses, one for the data RDO and
one for the signaling data RSIG. The receive highway is clocked on pin SCLKR, while
the interface to the transmit system highway is independently clocked on pin SCLKX.
The frequency of these working clocks and the data rate of 2.048/4.096/8.192/16.384
Mbit/s for the receive and transmit system interface is programmable.

- clock-rate:
  Supported values are: 2 (2.048 Mhz), 4 (4.096 Mhz), 8 (8.192 Mhz), 16 (16.384 Mhz).
  8 if not defined.

- data-rate:
  Supported values are: 2 (2.048 Mbit/sec), 4 (4.096 Mbit/sec), 8 (8.192 Mbit/sec), 16
  (16.384 Mbit/sec).
  8 if not defined.

Adjusting the frame begin (time slot 0, bit 0) relative to SYPR/X or XMFS is possible in
the range of 0 to 125 μs. The minimum shift of varying the time slot 0 begin can be
programmed between 1 bit and 1/8 bit depending of the system clocking and data rate,
e.g. with a clocking/data rate of 2.048 MHz shifting is done bit by bit, while running the
FALC®56 with 16.384 MHz and 2.048 Mbit/s data rate it is done by 1/8 bit

- channel-phase: First time slot transmission channel phase.
  Supported values are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
  0 if not defined.

All transmit or receive system interface data and marker are clocked or sampled with the
following active edge :
* Latched with the first falling edge of the selected PCM highway clock.
* Latched with the first rising edge of the selected PCM highway clock.
The behaviour of "transmit" and "receive" signals is inverse.

- rising-edge-sync-pulse: rising edge synchronous pulse.
  Supported values are: "receive", "transmit".
  "transmit" if not defined.
